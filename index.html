      Some cool stuff I've made:
    </h1>

    <h2>
      Late night trains never run on time
    </h2>

    <p>
      A short interactive fiction game about waiting for the subway late at night.
    </p>

      Built with Twine.

    <h2>
      Twitter Archive Deleter
    </h2>

    <p>
      A <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a> app that walks you through
      deleting your Twitter archive. It takes advantage of Glitch's super cool
      Remix feature to let people run their own copy of the app with their own
      credentials.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://twitter-archive-deleter.glitch.me/" target=
      "_blank">https://twitter-archive-deleter.glitch.me/</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Build with Node and the Twitter API.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Fleeborkin
    </h2>

    <p>
      Work together with a friend to repair your alien spaceship before it
      explodes!
    </p>

    <p>
      - <i>Playing for real requires stereo headphones that let one person
      listen to each side.</i><br>
      - The left channel repeats the name of an alien spaceship part. The
      player's job is to repeat the part's name out loud so their teammate
      knows what they're looking for.<br>
      - The right channel says the name of each part when you mouse over it.
      The player's job is to find and click the part that matches what their
      teammate is saying.<br>
      - Get all 6 before time runs out to win!
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>3rd place at Global Game Jam 2018 Playcrafting NYC site.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      Build with React. It was a 48 hour game jam so the code is rough, but the
      game is fun and that's all that matters.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Puppy Love
    </h2>

    <p>
      Two lost puppies have to find each other in a maze at the end of the
      world.
    </p>

    <p>
      - WASD controls one pup, arrow keys control the other<br>
      - At the jam site, each player wore a conductive glove. When they held
      hands with the gloves, it expanded the light around each pup so they can
      see.<br>
      - You can hold spacebar to do the same, but it isn't nearly as fun. Sorry
      :(<br>
      - Find each other in the maze before time runs out to win!
    </p>

      <i>Best use of controller at Global Game Jam 2015 NYU Game Center
      site.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      Built with vanilla Javascript becuase you make bad decisions at game
      jams.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Thar She Blows
    </h2>

    <p>
      Rescue the shipwrecked sailors before they drown in the whirlpool!
    </p>

    <p>
      - <i>Allow microphone access when the browser prompts it.</i><br>
      - The left and right arrow keys steer your ship.<br>
      - Blow into your microphone to make a wind gust and move your ship forward.<br>
      - Pick up the people and bring them to shore before they get sucked into
      the whirlpool.<br>
      - Play for a high score.

    <h2>
      NYC Subway Ads gallery
    </h2>

    <p>
      Gallery website showcasing New York City Subway advertising. It's
      designed to look kind of like the subway itself and has some slick
      transitions.

      pretty cool!
